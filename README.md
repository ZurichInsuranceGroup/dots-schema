# dots-schema #

A Schema class for advanced validation of any Javascript object. Inspired by [Meteor Simpleschema](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-simple-schema), but written in Typescript and without any meteor dependencies.

Discontinued due to lack of free time i have and am willing to dedicate to this.
